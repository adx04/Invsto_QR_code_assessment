## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - For state management

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of creating responsive designs and integrating state management with Redux. I learned how to use styled-components to create dynamic styles and how to implement a dark mode toggle using Redux for state management.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on advanced CSS techniques, state management with Redux, and creating more interactive components using React. I also want to explore more CSS animations to enhance user experience.

### Useful resources

- [Styled Components Documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs) - This helped me understand how to create dynamic styles in React.
- [Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) - This is an amazing resource to learn about state management in React applications.
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me with writing better markdown for my README file.
